This project is a PDF File Converter app made with Visual Studio & C# programmming language. The EXE file is available in the "bin" folder. Also a folder with examples of files converted is attached to the project. 
Main features I learned and build while developing this project:

- working with XAML files
- working with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- using NuGet Packages (Syncfusion)

The conversion types implemented: 
- PDF to DOC
- DOC to PDF
- PNG to PDF
